# Hi there 👋

## Programming in Practice Executive Summary

In this short video, I present an executive summary (3 min) of the Programming in Practice educational path. To get more, consider enrolling in [Programming in Practice - Executive Summary; free Udemy course][udemyPiPES]. This free course explains the role of [TP repository hosted on GitHub][TP] as a collection of extended examples that is a foundation for the `Programming in Practice` education path. The course is for all serious about improving the software development skills education methodology including but not limited to teachers and lecturers wanting to improve the software development skills education methodology. It is all about engineering atop University knowledge and practical experience as a foundation. Press the play button to open the video on `YouTube`.

## About

I have extensive experience in designing and deploying highly distributed applications, having managed over 100 innovative projects across various industries, including aviation, heat engineering, power engineering, and mining. I am the author of the [Object-Oriented Internet (OOI)][OOI] concept, the architect of the [CommServer™ (csvr)][csvr] communication software package for data transfer management and optimization, and the author and architect of the [SmartFactory™ (SF)][SF] workflow management system and software.

I am actively involved in numerous research projects as a researcher, university lecturer, and scientist. I am the author of many publications, lectures, presentations, and training sessions at the Technical University of Łódź (TUL). I hold a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from TUL and a Ph.D. in Process Control Engineering and Robotics.

For 14 years I have been an active member of the OPC Foundation involved in projects related to the OPC Unified Architecture design, adoption, deployment, and maintenance.

My current goal is to share my knowledge of IT solutions.

My mission is to promote Programming in Practice, focusing on various aspects of sequential, concurrent, real-time, and distributed programming.
